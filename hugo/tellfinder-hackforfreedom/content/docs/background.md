## Expose hidden connections to counter human trafficking

With an estimated 30,000 new adult services ads and reviews posted every day,
online data is a critical tool for locating victims and identifying those who exploit
them. The majority of these ads are posted on the “Deep Web,” unindexed by
Google and other search engines. These ads and posts are often temporary –
taken down before investigators can find them – and use unstructured data and
unlinked content to avoid being found

## Who uses TellFinder?

TellFinder is currently used by
investigators, analysts and detectives
in federal and local law enforcement
agencies, and successfully used
every day to help victims and find
those behind the crimes
